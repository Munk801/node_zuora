/**
 * create, update, subscribe, delete, et al
 *
 * Curious:
 *   Can we do atomic transactions by putting create, update, delete into the same
 *   XML?
 *
 * Can we handle more than 50 XML entries in the same SOAP request?
 *
 * Can we mix creates, updates and deletes in the same SOAP request?
 *
 * Is the XML case sensitive is zns:Create === zns:create ?
